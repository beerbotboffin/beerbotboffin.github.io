		<p>I own a BMW R1200RT which I love. It's a great bike, gobbling up the km's like it's nothing at all. The trouble is manoeuvring and storing it in the garage.</p>
		<p>So, I've decided to try 3D printing mecanum (omni) wheels which will mount to the centre stand and allow the old girl to be manoeuvred around laterally 'at the hips'
		in the garage (smooth floor). You see the issue isn't so much the space (though it's not a small bike by anyone's standards) - it's how unwieldy it is at slow speed.<br>
		And the panniers don't help, either.</p>
		<p>Actually, neither does the fact that it's a boxer twin (2 cylinders, with one sticking out either side of the engine). But I digress</p>
		<p>I've been thinking about this concept for sometime now, but looking at the commercially available products on the market (think tested & hopefully reliable) they're 
		<i><b>horrendously</b></i> expensive. About AUD$800 expensive last time I looked.<br>
		Now I know it's a BMW and it and all of the accessories for it are expensive, but geez, fair go. $800 for maybe 2m of bent tube and some wheels is a lot of Australia tax.
		So, being a maker I put some thought into the problem. Yes, I have the money, but it's hard to justify when the sole use is to push a bike around the shed.<br>
		Looking at a design on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2747161" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a> I printed one as proof of concept to see what it was like. First
		print looked and felt promising, so I reprinted at 90% infill and gave it another go. Modifying the design slightly using M5 Stainless Steel bolts and it feels pretty solid.<br>
		</p>
		<p>I'm at the final print stage - all of the wheel things are done, just printing the final hub. The next step is to design a mount to hold the centre stand, and be quick-detachable
		as I don't want it on the bike when I'm riding and I don't want to have to faff around for 30 minutes fitting them. I'm thinking something that slips over the feet and have a 
		bolt that I can tighten, then put the centre stand down. Part B will be moving the bike around comfortably in bliss.
		</p>
