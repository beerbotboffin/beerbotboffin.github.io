		<p>Well, let's be honest, the laser cutter hasn't been getting that much use of late.</p>
		<p>And given that a certain State Gubmint that I was working for the past couple of years laid all of us contractors off (<i>thanks covid</i>), I have a (very) little spare time on my hands.
		And I will actually miss some of the people I've come to know, which is a fair effort considering my status as a confirmed misanthrope.</p>
		<p>Anyway, the morning ritual for the team was to head a little down the street and get a morning coffee. Now I'm not a mad coffee-head like a lot of people these days,
		but I always went along for the social aspect (and have a ciggie in the fresh air).<br> 
		Now, one of the young ladies who'd serve us in the morning is named Ella. Ella is one of those beautiful, serene souls who always has something nice to say, even if you weren't always buying, and
		always had time for a smile and a chat even if you were walking past.</p>
		<p>As I won't be working from the office any longer, I was casting around for gift ideas (you're on my site, so you know I <i>much</i> prefer to make than buy gifts), when I saw something
		along the lines of what I've made and thought instantly of Ella. Actually, it ends up being wins all-round (apart from no longer having a contract) - Ella gets a gift, I get a new design
		/ process to add to the repetoire, I get to do something creative for a couple of hours, and hopefully Ella remembers my name in twenty years (it's engraved on the back...). And I
		guess the reverse is true too.</p>
