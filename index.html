		<p>Finally got the motivation to get the multi-monitor setup, set up. I have a number of LG E2340V monitors which whilst are good, are a bit retarded in that they lack VESA mounts. No worries, I have a 3D printer (OK, several 3D printers).</p>
		<p>My desk is a corner desk and I'd like to go 3 monitors wide and 2 high for a total of 6 monitors. I'm currently at 4 monitors so it's 3 wide with an extra in the middle </p>
		<p>I used OpenScad for the design and printed in eSun PLA+. You may note the 2 shades of white which is because I ordered white instead of cold white like I did last time. Oh well. You wouldn't have known if I didn't say anything, would you?</p>

		<p>I have a little mate who's good for company, but like most cats gets unhappy if he's not fed on time, every single time.</p>
		<p>What's a pain is that as I live alone I can't really go anywhere overnight as I have a ravenous little mouth to feed. Or if I'm in the office I come to home cries of 'Where have you been? I'm STARVING TO DEATH HERE!!!'. </p>
		<p>Looking to solve both problems, I've been working on a feeder system where I can pre-load small cans of cat food into a machine and have it dispense said wet food either on a scheduled basis or controlled remotely.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I own a BMW R1200RT which I love. It's a great bike, gobbling up the km's like it's nothing at all. The trouble is manoeuvring and storing it in the garage.</p>
	  <p>So, I've decided to try 3D printing mecanum (omni) wheels which will mount to the centre stand and allow the old girl to be manoeuvred around laterally 'at the hips'
	  in the garage (smooth floor). You see the issue isn't so much the space (though it's not a small bike by anyone's standards) - it's how unwieldy it is at slow speed.<br>
	  And the panniers don't help, either.</p>

      <p>I'm a middle aged man who grew up with a grandfather and father who both made and repaired things. I continue the tradition and I'm just sharing what I do.<br>
	  Though if I'm being honest, this is more about documenting projects - I <i>always</i> have numerous projects on the go at any one time (too fertile an imagination 
	  I guess, and seeing a pile of projects piling up it's nice to have a reminder that I actually do, from time to time, complete them. It's also nice to have a 
	  place to store notes.</p>
	  <p>This page is not elaborate - it's a simple static page which doesn't need much in the way of server resources</p>
	  <p><b>UPDATE</b> Jun 2021 - I've moved here to github pages because I found TPG mostly useless, even for serving static pages.</p>
