		<p>I sometimes make my printed circuit boards and need a way to Tin plate them.</p>
		<p>I've a got a recipe, but need a way to heat & mix the solutions - what I need is known as a magnetic stirrer. They exist, and not overly expensive from 
		the usual places in Mao's Dollarama (© AvE). But I wanted to make my own.</p>
		<p>I started by buying a 40W Silicone heater pad, 100mm dia Aluminium (yes, Aluminium), stirrer bars, beaker and an OLED display from ebay. I have a bunch of NodeMCU's in stock, so 
		they weren't an issue.<br>
		Next up was designing an enclosure to 3D print. I'll upload the files to shittyverse when it's done.<br>
		I've been prototyping the firmware and learning KiCAD to design a PCB to mount the electronics. When the PCB design is finished, I'll either mill it on the small
		CNC or chemically etch the board. How do I plate it? Good question...</p>
		<p>Yes, I know could just order the PCBs from somewhere like JLCPCB, but given that I'm an amateur electronics designer I often get it wrong and need to iterate. With
		the CNC mill I can (will) prototype and iterate a board in hours, not weeks.<p>
		<p>Now, you won't see it until I make some more progress and post photos, but one of the design parameters is to keep it compact. Thus I decided on no externals controls 
		(no switches, pots etc) and control the heating and RPM with a web interface via Wifi.</p>

		<p><i>Stay tuned for more updates</i></p>
