		<p>Do I need a new power supply? Well, sort of not really. I have a common, garden variety Chinese 5A bench power supply, but there's a few things I don't like about it.</p>
		<p>First up, it's a brick - it weighs a tonne. Secondly, it's a bitch to adjust the voltage due to the display lag - it's <i>waaaaaay</i> too slow to update the display. Lastly, it's too deep - 
		it takes up too much real estate on the desk.</p>
		<p>Now, there's a bare power module from Mao's Dollarama that looks nice - it's compact, programmable and has a nice display. It's like a poor mans commercial supply.</p>
		<p>Now, it doesn't come with a transformer / power supply itself, but I do have an old power supply(very similar to the current one but with duff electronics) so I'm re-tasking the
		transformer from it. What I decided on was to mount the transformer in a seperate case which lives on the floor so that it's not taking up real estate on the desk / bench. I've designed 
		the cases in openscad and the files are available here on github. I printed them in eSun white PLA and think they're come up a treat. I quite like the air vents in the transformer case which
		as you can see from the photos are slotted and match the curve of the case. The bench case took a couple of more goes to get 'just right' - but I think it came up alright. The case is designed
		to fit with the soldering iron (the 'l' in solder is not silent, BTW) and the hot air reflow tool so that only minimal bench space is used.	</p>
		<p>Getting the 3D printed case just right has taken a little longer than planned, but after a few revisions, I now have a mount for using a Makita LXT battery and switching between that and
		the transformer. This will allow me to use the power supply in a mobile mode (such as when trying to learn to fly my R/C aircraft or camping for some reason).
		</p>
		<p><b>UPDATE <i>2 Aug 2020</b></i> All of the work I can do for the moment, currently waiting on sheet brass to arrive from China which I need to make the electrodes for the battery contacts.</p>
		<p><b>UPDATE <i>5 Aug 2020</b></i> After realising I had a bit of a 'seniors moment', it occurred to me that I already have a bench supply that I can use to supply the new supply to actually 
		to test the new supply. Jeez, this getting old sucks. But we got there in the end, hey? I'm currently having a couple of wee drams of the delicious Drambuie, but the plan is to cack-up (old Army
		expression) a test cable - banana plugs to XT-60. Hmmm, I guess this means that the supply is now a 4 mode supply. I can (will be able to) power it via any of the following methods:
		<ul>
		<li>The new transformer I made <i>or</i></li>
		<li>a Makita LXT 18v LiPo battery <i>or</i></li>
		<li>the old bench supply <i>or</i></li>
		<li>the big arse 6000mAh LiPo battery I have.</li>
		</ul>
		Nice.</p>
